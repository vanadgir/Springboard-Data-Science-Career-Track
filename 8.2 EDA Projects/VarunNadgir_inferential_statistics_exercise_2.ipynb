    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "### Exercises\n",
    "You will perform a statistical analysis to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.\n",

    "   1. What test is appropriate for this problem? Does CLT apply?\n",
    "   2. What are the null and alternate hypotheses?\n",
    "   3. Compute margin of error, confidence interval, and p-value. Try using both the bootstrapping and the frequentist statistical approaches.\n",
    "   4. Write a story describing the statistical significance in the context or the original problem.\n",
    "   5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?\n",

    "#### What test is appropriate for this problem? Does CLT apply?\n",
    "The most appropriate test for this problem would likely be the two-sample test, since we can use it to compare \"white-sounding\" names and \"black-sounding\" names and their callback rates. CLT may apply here, but it really depends on if the callback rates are unbiased or not (which is basically what we are exploring). If we were to add more and more points, we may in fact discover that the distribution does not approach a normal curve and that it is skewed because of racial discrimination. But in theory, CLT should apply.\n",
    "#### What are the null and alternate hypotheses?\n",
    "The null hypothesis is that there is NO significant difference between callback rates for different names. The alternate hypothesis is that names do somehow affect the callback rates. If our p-value is small (< 0.05) then we reject the null hypothesis and we might consider that there is indeed a difference."
