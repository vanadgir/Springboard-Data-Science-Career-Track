    "I would like to put myself in the role of an esports analyst, so my client could be any of the North American organizations with a League of Legends team. As someone in this role, not only would I need to be familiar with trends in our local region, but when international tournaments come around, the organization will be relying on their team of analysts to help prepare the players for new competition. Identifying any sort of trends and patterns in another team or region's playstyle would be a big leg up, and that will come from intelligent study of the data."

    "All of the competitive League of Legends data is collected by [Oracle's Elixir](http://oracleselixir.com/match-data/), and for this study I will be looking at the Spring 2018 data. There are about 15,000 rows and almost 100 columns in this dataset - each match has 5 entries for the players of one team, 5 for the other, and then 2 for team-wide stats. After importing the .csv file, it was just a matter of preparing the dataset for each question by subsetting into smaller tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "At some point in the future, it would also be helpful to look at the data collected by Riot Games in the competitive ranked ladder. These data could shed light into how certain Champion matchups might be expected to go or if some objectives tend to lead to wins more than others, among other things. There are hundreds of thousands of games played around the world daily, meaning there is a lot of valuable data being generated constantly.\n",

At the time, these Champions were very strong and were able to be picked regardless of the opponent due to how reliable and useful they were to their teams. Other Champions in this matrix with fewer games could be seen as 'counterpicks', or response picks specifically chosen to answer another Champion. \n",

However, the next question this raises is whether teams are winning because of taking these towers or if teams were able to take these towers because they were already winning. In other words, at what point in the game do we say the teams are even and when do we say one comfortably has a lead?"
